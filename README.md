# What You Will Learn 🚀

In this course, you will learn:

- **Solidity basics:** You will start with the basics of Solidity, learning about variables and how to build a basic calculator contract.

- **Blockchain deployment:** Learn how to deploy your Solidity contracts to a blockchain.

- **Deep dive into Solidity:** You will explore in depth topics like mappings, arrays, structs, require statements, modifiers, and events.

- **Build a Class Room Contract:** Step-by-step, you will build a ClassRoom contract.

- **Advanced Solidity concepts:** Towards the end of the course, you will learn about loops, contract inheritance, and contract-to-contract interaction.

- **Final Project:** At the end of the course, you will recieve a final challenge project to showcase your skills.
- **Comming soon** FundME project + Raffle Game + StableCoin using Chainlink VRF and ERC20 and more..

I want to create an opportunity to deliver immense value to you throughout this course while we build amazing projects together! 🌟  

My mission is to help YOU 👇  

1️⃣ Become the Solidity developer you've always dreamed of being without needing a college degree.  

2️⃣ Transform your career into a thriving business that grants you the freedom you deserve in the future.  

3️⃣ Make learning and coding as fun and exciting as possible! 🎉  

The only way to achieve this is by reaching and inspiring as many people as we can. And let’s face it—people often judge a book by its cover (reviews and comments). So, if you've gotten any value from this course so far, I’d truly appreciate it if you could take a moment to leave an honest review!  

It’ll take less than 60 seconds, costs absolutely nothing, and can make a HUGE difference:  

👉 Help aspiring developers like you discover this course and start learning.  

👉 Support developers in building better futures for themselves and their families.  

👉 Create success stories that might never happen otherwise.  

### What’s next?  

In the upcoming lessons, we’ll dive into **amazing projects** like:  

- A **Raffle Game** to master randomness in Solidity  
- Building our very own **Stablecoin** 🪙  
- Exploring beautiful tools like **Chainlink** for oracles and randomness.  
- Deep dives into **ERC20** and **gas optimization techniques** to make your contracts efficient and cost-effective.  

But wait, there’s more! 😄  

At the end of this course, I’ll create the **ULTIMATE tutorial on Foundry** for testing and deploying smart contracts. We'll use it to build an **NFT Marketplace** from scratch—combining the power of Solidity and Foundry to make something truly exceptional.
